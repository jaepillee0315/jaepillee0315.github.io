``A Structural Analysis of Opioid Misuse: Labor, Health, Perception of Opioid Misuse Risk, and
State-level Restrictions on Opioid Prescribing'' (Job Market Paper)

**Abstract:** This paper studies the economic drivers and behavioral aspect of opioid misuse. While the literature has been focusing on the supply-side drivers of the opioid crisis, little attention has been paid to the demand-side driver. This paper develops a dynamic discrete choice model of labor and opioid misuse with stochastic perception bias on opioid misuse risk. The estimation result shows that there exists some role of the perception bias on opioid misuse, but labor market displacement is the strongest driver of opioid misuse. The substitution effect of reducing access to prescription opioids increases opioid mortality rates, as using illegal opioids have become more lethal.

``Identification of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models with Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting under
Finite Dependence''

**Abstract:** In this paper, I generalize the representation theorem in Arcidiacono and Miller (2019) in dynamic discrete choice models with quasi-hyperbolic discounting. Then I provide identification result given the two-period finite dependence and exclusion restriction in a finite horizon model. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the exclusion restriction is strong enough to separate the discount factor and present bias.

``Sufficient Conditions for Identification of Dynamic Discrete Choice Models under Finite Dependence''

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the role of finite dependence paths in identification in dynamic discrete choice models. I prove constructively that there exists a maximum number of these paths, which exponentially grows by the number of states and choices. This growth helps explain the lack of consensus on the number of paths for reliable identification. In one-period finite dependence settings, identification of flow utilities is achieved by the full rank condition. Further, by examining a two-period finite dependence setting as a special case of multiple-period finite dependence, I demonstrate methods to determine identification for utility contrasts.
