I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University. I am joining the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP) as a Research Associate.

My research area lies at the intersection of labor and health economics, with a focus on structural methods. I also develop new methodologies for dynamic discrete choice models.
