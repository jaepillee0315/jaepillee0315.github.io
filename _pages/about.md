I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University. I specialize in structural econometrics and dynamic discrete choice models. I study:
- Why do people make hazardous choices in their lifecycle and what are the policies to help them stay away from them
- Lifecycle choices in labor supply, marriage, fertility, and homeownership.
- Locally robust estimation in dynamic discrete choices.
