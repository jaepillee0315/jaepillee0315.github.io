I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University.

My research area is in the intersection of labor, public, and health economics. I am also interested in developing new methodologies in dynamic discrete choice models.

I am on the job market in 2024-2025.
