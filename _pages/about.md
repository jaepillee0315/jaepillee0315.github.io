I am a Research Fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research area lies at the intersection of labor and health economics, with a focus on structural analysis. I also develop new methodologies for dynamic discrete choice models (i.e., inverse reinforcement learning in ML language).
